          Hey there! My name is Francis and I am a british techie nerd working
          in Munich, Germany. I have a passion for several things including
          design, architecture (the building kind), music - in particular
          singing, travelling and constantly learning. This site is something i
          dreamt up recently after putting off making my own website for a long
          time. If you want to get in touch with me about anything, you can

        <h2>Things About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Back about 7000 years ago I actually started working as a professional
          singer when I was then 16. Although I had always wanted to get into
          computers, unfortunately I never had the means to when I was in my
          teens. This was mostly due to the fact that I worked weekends and also
          had to stay late at school most days because I was a music scholar.
          But I'd be lying if I said the partying didn't also get in the way ðŸ˜‡.
        </p>
        <p>
          Weirdly, I decided to study chemistry at university, with a focus on
          energy storage (at EPFL, Switzerland) and Molecular Dynamics Sampling
          methods (at Edinburgh University, Scotland) where I gained a masters
          degree along with two publications which you can access
          <a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/C4EE00098F">here</a> and
          <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b03296">here</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          By the time I finished university, I really didn't know where I was
          going. I tried a variety of avenues including getting offered a PhD in
          Singapore, which I ended up turning down for my current job. I have
          now been working as a fullstack developer for about 3 years and have
          been loving blending design with technology. And that brings us to
          where you are right now; looking at this page :-).
